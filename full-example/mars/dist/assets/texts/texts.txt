Officer  en-US-E (Amy) (JoAna)
This is officer Tereshkova. My ship crashed on Acidalia Planitia but I'm not sure about the exact location.
I'm fine but I'm running out of supplies and I need to find some oxygen source. 
According to our latest debrief the remain of the last Ares Mission should be close so I'm moving there. 
I've to slow down my steps or my Oxygen will be depleted faster.
If anybody is listening, please contact me as soon as possible. 

Captain (Mathew)
Diary of Captain Brown. This is my first day here. 
I was able to find this wreckage and get some oxygen. I'll try to communicate with using anything.
If my calculations are correct, the containers left by SpaceX must be in the North.

----------------------------------
Episode 1

Captain
I'm still alone. I've found communication devices that still work. 
I'm trying to establish contact with mission control but I'm not getting any answer. 
I'll keep on trying it. I should find another landing zone if I head to North East.

Officer
This is officer Tereshkova. The ship crashed but I survived the impact. If anybody is listening, please help.


----------------------------------
Episode 2

Captain
Still no contact. This planitia is really dangerous and the ground is too thin in some spots. 
I activated the geological scanner and when it started beeping I just moved away. 
There should be other remains if I move to the south east.

Officer
This is officer Tereshkova. I'm using oxygen and vehicle parts to keep on going. If anybody is listening, please answer.

----------------------------------
Episode 3

Captain
I almost got killed today. We left several land raider robots and they are still working! 
But their code has gone nuts! They hide underground and they move towards me as soon as I'm located. 
I just have to run away from them but they are getting smarter. There should be more containers on the east.

Officer
Officer Tereshkova here. I've found the diary of Captain Braun, but there is no sign of him or any live here. If anybody is listening, please. ANSWER.

----------------------------------
Episode 4

Captain
I'm running out of supplies. Sometimes I find dehydrated food but this won't be enough. 
Some of the remains seems to be already sacked. But that's obviously impossible, I was the first man on this planet. 
I'll look for more on the north east.

Officer 
Officer Tereshkova. Again. I don't know how long I'll be able to survive. I'm alone. Please. answer.

----------------------------------
Episode 5
Captain
I'm trying to keep calm otherwise I could easily go crazy. There is a very weird ship here. I can't 
identify its source but it seems very damaged. I found something that looks like footsteps. 
I know that these could just be created by stones or the wind, but the outlines look artificial.

Officer 
Tereshkova here. Is anybody out there? Please. Anyone. Help.

Episode 6
Soviet words...

Officer
